				<p class="quote">“Addiego shows skill in developing varied yet realistic voices for his characters. As you would imagine in the newly settled west in the mid 19th century, there are people from a variety of environments and socio-economic backgrounds. The author presents these differences well and the narrative is the better for it...There is much to like about <i>Tears of the Mountain</i> and some great technical skill displayed in its execution...a satisfying read on many levels...There is something for most readers in this novel. It is a job well done.”</p>

				<p class="quote">“With <i>The Islands of Divine Music</i>,  John Addiego achieves a deft and graceful balancing act--a tender but unflinching fictional interface of pragmatism and passionate faith. As Addiego investigates the twentieth century American experience by way of southern Italian lore and Mexican mysticism, he delivers a novel that somehow manages to be both succinct and expansive, both grounded and otherworldly. I was moved and entertained by this truly original story."”</p>
